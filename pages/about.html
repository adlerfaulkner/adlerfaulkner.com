<p>Hi!</p>

<p>I’m Adler, a designer and creator experimenting in many media to produce useful, sophisticated, & playful objects. I am a co-founder of and the Head of Product at <a target='_blank' href='https://comake.io'>comake.io</a>, working to help hopeless knowledge workers centralize their digital work lives for improved collaboration, productivity, and innovation.</p>

<p>Aside from Comake, I enjoy creating new experiences building other websites (like this one!), games, mobile apps, paintings, sculptures, & devices.</p>

<p>Currently, I am studying at Cornell University where an unconventional independent major in Product Design allows me to tinker, explore, and learn by doing across university departments & disciplines.</p>

<p>I find joy in creating, dreaming and living with confidence and pushing myself to discover new perspectives of individuals and society. I love those who live out of their comfort zone, <a target='_blank' href='https://vimeo.com/30251329'>think differently</a>, and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.creativeconfidence.com/'>embrace failure</a> as part of the process toward realizing their true potential.</p>

<p>Feel free to contact me at <a target='_blank' href='mailto:adlerfaulkner@gmail.com?Subject=I%20found%20you%20website%21'>adlerfaulkner@gmail.com</a>.</p>
